    <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>



    <p>Bootstraptor (“Website”) is committed to the security of your information and pledges to follow the terms set out
      in this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”).</p>



    <p></p>



    <h3>WEBSITE INFORMATION USAGE</h3>



    <p>We use web stat services to track the location, browser, operating system and screen resolution of our visitors,
      but not private information about each individual (such as your name or email address). E-mail addresses are only
      ever provided by the user voluntarily through the commenting process or via newsletter subscription or via e-mail
      communications. Note: E-mail addresses that are entered in the required “e-mail” field in the comments area, are
      not
      publicly displayed. We aggregate user-specific information on what pages consumers access or visit, and
      information
      volunteered by readers, such as survey information and/or Website registrations. The information we collect is
      used
      to improve the content of our Website in a technical fashion only and not for marketing purposes.<br></p>



    <h3>PUBLIC INFORMATION</h3>



    <p>Our Website enables you to post information to be accessed by others through our comments. When you do so, other
      visitors may collect your data and attempt to contact you off the site. We cannot be held liable for any offsite
      communications that result from your posting of personal information on our site. If you do not wish to be
      contacted
      offsite by other website visitors, do not give your e-mail address or website address in the content when leaving
      a
      comment. Please note: Although you are given the option to provide your e-mail address in the specified field when
      entering a comment, your e-mail address will only be available to the website administrators and will not be
      publicly
      visible.<br></p>



    <h3>ADVERTISERS</h3>



    <p>Third-party advertisers featured on the website may collect tracking information in a different manner than is
      set
      out in this Privacy Policy. The only information that they will be able to track is basic Website usage
      information;
      e-mail addresses are not passed on to advertisers for any reason even if they are provided to the website
      voluntarily.<br></p>



    <h3>COOKIES</h3>



    <p>We use cookies to store visitor preferences, record user-specific information on what pages users access or
      visit,
      customize Website content based on visitor browser type or other information that the visitor sends.<br></p>



    <h3>USE OF INFORMATION PROVIDED BY USER</h3>



    <p>We do not use the information provided by users, such as e-mail addresses and contents of e-mail, for any
      marketing
      purposes. Your personal information is not used by subsidiary organizations or businesses related to the website,
      unless clearly disclosed for specific situations.<br></p>



    <h3>INFORMATION OWNERSHIP</h3>



    <p>All e-mails, comments or other forms of communication received by the website are the property of the website and
      may be used for editorial or technical improvements to the Website at our discretion without any form of
      compensation
      being owed to the sender of said communications.<br></p>



    <h3>INFORMATION SECURITY</h3>



    <p>We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities and the facilities of our service
      providers to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our
      Website. Information provided by Website visitors is held in confidence and used for editorial and technical
      improvements to the Website.<br></p>



    <h3>AFFILIATE PROGRAMS, SPONSORED POSTS, ETC</h3>



    <p>From time to time we may choose to use affiliate links and/or sponsored posts as an effort to generate extra
      income
      to our website. The appearance of such links or sponsored content in this site is determined by its informational
      or
      inspirational value and not by its commercial value to us. We will only promote products and services that we like
      and feel are beneficial to our audience and these will be properly disclosed as sponsored.<br></p>



    <h3>THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING</h3>



    <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads and collect information when users visit our site. These
      companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your
